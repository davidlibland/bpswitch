# arduino-bpswitch

This project contains the logic for an Arduino Nano to control a bypass looper for guitar pedals.
It is intended to control 8 loops along with a fixed insert loop (e.g. for a volume pedal, or to/from the 
effects loop of an amp). The minimalist controls are inspired by the BYOC super-8.
